# FlappyBird-ML-Project
The goal of this project is to better understand the fundamental ideas behind artifical intelligence and neuroevolutionary algorithms, such as NEAT. This is based off TechWithTim's YouTube tutorial series of the same name. NOTE: I haven't been able to finished the project yet, but am close in doing so.
