# FlappyBird-ML-Project
The goal of this project is to better understand the fundamental ideas behind artifical intelligence and neuroevolutionary algorithms, such as NEAT. This is based off TechWithTim's YouTube tutorial series of the same name. NOTE: The comments are centered around me trying to understand what each line of code means and how it works. TU means to come back to later.
