Notes:
So, we start out with our original neuron network, with each connection having a certain weight. However, this then creates random neuron cells
connect to the next layer based upon these weights. Done to find a topology. (TU: 6:43:39). Using activation function, TANH, to see if we
want to jump or not. It squishes our values between 1 and -1 and if we have a value above 0.5, jump, otherwise don't. Our fitness
function just counts how many frames the bird has made it, and the bird that made through the most frames is the most fit bird.
